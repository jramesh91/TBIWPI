      <h3>WELCOME</h3>
      <p>Your loved one has a serious traumatic brain injury (TBI) and has been in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) for several days now.<br><br>
He/She is currently not able to make medical decisions. Because your loved one cannot tell us what treatment plan he/she would want, your help is needed. We have arrived at a point at which you are asked to make a very important decision for him/her, called the <b>“goals of care”</b> decision.
<br><br>
This decision is easy for some, but difficult for most. We have created this tool (decision aid) to help you better understand the choices, and to guide you to make the best choice for your loved one. 
This tool was made with input from people like you who have made this decision in the past. 
<br><br>
<b>This tool will NOT replace a meeting with the doctor but will help you when you talk to the doctor about the decision and the choices.</b>

<h3>WHAT IS A MECHANICAL VENTILATOR</h3>        
  <p>A mechanical ventilator is a breathing machine that provides artificial breathing support. <br>
  The ventilator pumps air and oxygen into the lungs through a breathing tube. This breathing tube goes through the mouth into the windpipe. It is also called “life support”.
<br>The ventilator supports a patient while treatments are given for their medical problem, like TBI. <br>
<b>The ventilator itself does not cure the injury.</b>
<br><br>
<h3>WHAT IT IS TO BE ON A MECHANICAL VENTILATOR</h3>  
<p>It is uncomfortable to be on a ventilator. Patients often need medicines for pain and to help them relax while they are on it. 
<br>Patients cannot eat or drink by mouth while on a ventilator because of the tubes in their mouth. 
<br><br>Patients cannot make a sound when on a ventilator.
<br>Patients who are on a ventilator are very sick. They are usually on them for several days or weeks. 
<br>Many TBI patients cannot breathe or swallow on their own for many weeks or months. <br><b>Therefore, the doctor will ask you to make an important decision.</b>
</p>
<br>
<h3>WHAT DECISION AM I BEING ASKED TO MAKE?</h3>  
<p>Your loved one is still on a ventilator, and despite the best care from the doctors and nurses, your loved one is unable to come off the ventilator and breathe on his/her own.
<br>
At this point, there are <b>2 different treatment goals.</b>
<br>
<b>You are being asked to make a decision: which of these 2 treatment goals best aligns with your loved one’s goals, values and preferences.</b>
<br>
The treatment goal that you choose will affect what kinds of procedures and care are done for your loved one while they are in the ICU and afterwards.</p>

<h2>HOW DO I MAKE THIS DECISION</h2>      
<p>Your family member is too sick to make his/her own medical decisions. Therefore, someone close to them like you must do it – you are the one most likely to know what he/she would want.
<br>
<b>Your job is to make the decision <i>your loved one would want</i> if they could talk to us.</b>
<br>
<b>Your job is <u>not</u> to make the decision that <u>you</u> want.</b>
<br><br>
<b>Consider these things</b> when making this important decision for your loved one:
<br>
What kind of person were they before the injury? What did they like to do? What were they able to do? What if they can’t go back to their normal quality of life? Would they be happy?
<br><br>
Think about what your loved one would want:
<br>
Some people know that their loved one would not want to be dependent on others (short or long-term), or would not want a trach or feeding tube.
You may have never talked about these things. Still, it is important to think about conversations you may have had with your loved one about similar issues. Have they ever been around someone who has had a brain injury or stroke, or trach and feeding tube?

<p>Even after thinking about the decision and options, you may still not be sure what is best for your loved one. Many people in this situation feel this way.<br>
Some of the reasons may be:
<br>
You need to talk with others first.
You may still have questions about the treatment choices.
You need a little more time to think about things.</p>

      <p>Family members like you have told us that examples of other patients and their families are helpful to them for understanding the choices.<br><br>
We will now take a look at two patient examples, who are in the ICU for treatment of their brain injury. These two patients have many differences. Their families will have to think about these differences when making a decision about the goal of care (survival or comfort).<br><br>
As you read these examples, try to think about what your family member might want in each situation.</p>

        <div class="panel-body">Ms. Smith is a 35-year-old previously healthy woman who injured her head when she fell down the stairs. She is now unconscious. She is an avid runner. She is currently working full-time as an accountant. Because of her injury, she undergoes surgery to remove the blood from one area of her brain. She remains sleepy and confused during her ICU stay. She does not have any other major ICU problems during her stay. Ms. Smith:<br><br>
1) Is relatively young, healthy and active<br>
2) Has a treatable brain injury<br>
3) Does not have any other injuries<br>
4) Does not have major problems like infection, high blood pressure, or seizures while in the hospital<br><br>
The doctor thinks that Ms. Smith won’t be able to breathe or eat on her own any time soon. The doctor expects that her chance of surviving until 6 months and beyond is very high. She will probably improve to some degree, but it is not sure she will ever be independent and work as an accountant again. The doctor asks the parents to help decide which goals of care best align with Ms. Smith’s values and preferences.<br><br>
This is an example of how the parents may fill out the worksheet to help them decide about which general goal of care is best for their daughter:</div>

        <div class="panel-body"><br>
       <b>1) What do you understand about the outlook of your loved one, and the options?</b><br><br>
<i>“Overall the doctor thinks that she may improve, although there is a lot of uncertainty here. She will definitely need some form of LTACH or nursing home after the ICU, and then hopefully rehabilitation later. She will definitely need a trach and feeding tube before then. We understand the pros and cons of both options: survival or comfort care.”</i><br><br>

<b>2) What would your loved one want?</b><br><br>
<i>“Our daughter had a high school classmate before with a TBI and she knows what a trach/feeding tube look like. She was not opposed to it as long as she has a chance of getting rid of it. We know our daughter; she is a runner and has run marathons. This will be even longer than training for a marathon, but she will want to give it a try.”</i><br><br>

<b>3) How is this choice making you feel?</b><br><br>
<i>
“We don’t like seeing her in pain, but at the same time from her marathon running she knows how to fight through the pain. We trust the doctors that they will do whatever they can to lessen the pain throughout the procedures.”
</i><br><br>
<b>
4) What questions do you need answered before you can decide?</b>
<i><br><br>
“We have a few questions regarding the procedures themselves and how to get her to the next level of care after the ICU. We have written down the questions and are meeting with the doctor to get them answered. We know that the Social Worker and Case manager will talk to us about what the next steps are regarding finding a place for after the ICU and acute care hospital.”

<br>“We are leaning towards continuing advanced medical care and going forward with the trach and feeding tube and what follows after the ICU stay. We know it’s going to be a long, painful road ahead, but we know our daughter’s endurance and will power. She would accept a lower quality of life and keep fighting to make the best of her life.”

He has many areas of bleeding located deep inside his brain, and is in a coma. He also has a broken leg and many broken ribs. One of his broken ribs has injured his lungs. While in the hospital, he gets an infection in his lungs (pneumonia). Mr. Alvarez:<br><br>

The doctor thinks that Mr. Alvarez won’t be able to breathe or eat on his own any time soon, if ever. The doctor expects that his chance of surviving 6 months is low. He may improve to some degree, but will probably never be independent again. Whether he may go home ever again is unclear.
